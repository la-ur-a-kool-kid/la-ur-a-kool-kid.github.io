    <p><b>Bio:</b> I am a girl who codes from Earth, the Milky Way. I will be entering the 10th grade in the fall, and I am looking forward to finally being able to leave my lower-class-men-hood. I live at home with my lit fam. When I'm not coding, you can find me listening to music or sleeping.</p>

    <p><b>Likes:</b> I love a great fiction novel. Right now I am reading <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=a+tree+grows+in+brooklyn&oq=a+tree+&aqs=chrome.0.0j69i60j69i57j0l3.1583j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">A Tree Grows in Brooklyn</a>, by Betty Smith. <br>
      <b>Dislikes:</b> I really don't like MUSHROOMS. MUSHROOMS ARE THE EPITOME OF ALL THE HEALTHY BUT UTTERLY DISGUSTING FOODS ON THIS VERY PLANEY. NO CHILD DESERVES TO SUFFER THE WRATH OF THE MUSHRROM. THEY NEED TO BE ERADICATED, ERADICATED I SAY. WIPED OFF FROM THE FACE OF THIS EARTH. GONE. GONE LIKE HOPE FOR THIS GENERATION OR HONEST POLITICS OR THE WIND. DONT PUT ON PIZZA ALSO.
